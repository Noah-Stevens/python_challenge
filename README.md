Week 3 Challenge

I primarily used chatGPT and Stack Overflow forums to assist with certain parts of the code, especially trying to do a percentage function in PyPoll, so I went with using "def" from that assistance.

For the output, I did look to Alexander's output coding as what I need to base mine off of, as it was something I wasn't used to doing yet and a specific aesthetic was needed that his would reflect.

Also, I haven't dealt with transferring output to a .txt file, so I felt that it was necessary.

The largest issue I ran into and spent way too long figuring out here to the end was how to list all three candidates in PyPoll.

I figured out how to fenagle the vote counts, but I assume I would have to restructure some aspect of my dictionary to make it work, which I can revisit at another time.

I hope the rest looks good! Again almost all of the comments are me, my variables I believe are pretty original (as much as they can be) and I put my own flair into the code. 

I used assistance, but I found myself putting aside the training wheels of the starter code comments the professor has put in for us.

I am excited for the upcoming challenges.

Thanks for reading!
